# Joan

Joan is a bot writen in Python for my Age of Empires 2 Discord server. Every user on the server has a rating (roughly corresponding to their 1v1 rating). This rating is used to automatically balance team games. The bot can be used to generate balanced civs suited to their position (no more Inca pocket). The main packages used are: `discord`, `pandas`, `random`.
